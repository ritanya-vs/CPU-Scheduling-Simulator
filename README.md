# CPU Scheduling SimulatorðŸš€

## Overview
The **CPU Scheduling Simulator** is a web-based application built using React.js that simulates various CPU scheduling algorithms. This tool helps users understand and visualize how different scheduling algorithms work by generating Gantt charts and calculating key performance metrics.

## ðŸ“‹Features
- Supports multiple CPU scheduling algorithms:
  - First Come First Serve (FCFS)
  - Shortest Job First (SJF)
  - Highest Response Ratio Next (HRRN)
  - Priority Scheduling
- Dynamic input for process details (Arrival Time, Burst Time, and Priority).
- Calculates key performance metrics for each algorithm:
  - Average Turnaround Time
  - Average Waiting Time
- Generates a Gantt chart for visualizing the scheduling.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React.js

## Usage
1. Select the CPU scheduling algorithm you want to simulate from the dropdown menu.
2. Enter the number of processes and their details (Arrival Time, Burst Time, and Priority).
3. Click on the **Simulate** button to run the simulation.
4. View the Gantt chart and key performance metrics generated.
